# convert-fdf-sounds-to-arma3 (WIP)

Convert Arma 2 FDF sounds to Arma 3 by renaming and concatenating voice files. Quick and dirty.

# Usage

`python3 converta2toa3.py --input <directory> --output <directory>`

# TODO

- ~~use args for input and output instead of hardcoding them~~
- ~~add creating arma 3 folders~~
- finish up cataloging all the arma 2 sound files and arma3 destinations
- collect a list of the sound-files that need to be manually touched up
