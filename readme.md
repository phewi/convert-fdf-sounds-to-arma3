# Convert Arma 2 FDF sounds to Arma 3 (WIP)

Convert Arma 2 FDF sounds to Arma 3 by renaming and concatenating voice files. Quick and dirty.
Heavily in progress, probably will make a release when it's doing everything it's supposed to do

# Usage

`python3 converta2toa3.py --input <directory> --output <directory>`

# TODO

- [x] Use args for input and output instead of hardcoding them
- [x] Add creating arma 3 folders
- [x] Grid numbers concat and move
- [ ] Finish up cataloging all the arma 2 sound files and arma3 destinations
- [ ] Collect a list of the sound-files that need to be manually touched up
- [ ] Check for compatibility for linux and windows
- [ ] Write instructions
